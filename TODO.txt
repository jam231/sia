TODO LIST:

Top priority:
    - Object market, which handles all the logic and
      QApplication are disjoint. What I mean is...
      there's NO working server!
      After market object initialization, loading config, setting up
      the connections there's just nothing for the market left to do,
      so it ends it's life, and after that QApplication starts... !
      Must fix !

Urgent:
    - Choose error handling strategy // Done, oexceptions.



    - Test ConfigManager class      // Done
    - After it has been proven (by test not formally) to work,
      incorporate ConfigManager into Marker class, deleting
      static const fields. // Done.

Quite important:

    - Choose a logging facility,
    - Incorporate chosen logging facility,

Maybe someday:

    - initParser::parseINI returns QVector<QPair<QString, QString> >
      It may be slow (not likely for the current usage, but still..)
      Find a clever way to overcome this (check if it's even an issue).
